# Game-o-war-MSP1

This was my first card game I played, I remember playing this for hours on the floor with my sister when we were young. Now I can play this game on my computer.

This game is simple, 2 player game, you vs the CPU, you pull a card at the same time as the CPU and who ever has the higher card wins one point. If the cards are the same value no point is awarded.
